Database Design and Implementation


To design relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and to make it easier for executives to make data driven decisions.

Currently the data resides in several different systems: Accounting software, suppliers' databases, point of sales (POS) systems, and even spreadsheets. I will review the data in all of these systems and design a central database to house all data. I will then create the database objects and load them with source data. Finally, I will create subsets of data that the business partners require, export them, and then load them into staging databases that use different RDBMS.


**working with data from the following sources:**

Staff information held in a spreadsheet at headquarters (HQ)

Sales outlet information held in a spreadsheet at HQ

Sales data output as a CSV file from the POS system in the sales outlets

Customer data output as a CSV file from a custom customer relationship management system

Product information maintained in a spreadsheet exported from your supplier's database
